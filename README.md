# Flight Reservation System
The system consists of several flights, each of which has many seats at different prices. <br/>
Customers attempt to book seats on these flights, by trying to find seats within their budget. Proposed implementation is an atom based. Decision behind choosing atom primitive for flights is because we do not want to have race conditions in our system.

This project was written as a part of Multicore Programming study.
